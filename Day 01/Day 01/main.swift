// Fuel required to launch a given module is based on its mass.
// Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.

func fuelRequired(for mass: Int) -> Int {
    return (mass / 3) - 2
}

/* Examples:
 For a mass of 12, divide by 3 and round down to get 4, then subtract 2 to get 2.
 For a mass of 14, dividing by 3 and rounding down still yields 4, so the fuel required is also 2.
 For a mass of 1969, the fuel required is 654.
 For a mass of 100756, the fuel required is 33583.
